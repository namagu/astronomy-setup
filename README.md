# astronomy-setup
Setting up my Mac for astronomy coding, specifically to run Chelsea Huang's [FFIToolsPub](https://github.com/chelseah/FFIToolsPub)

I'm making this in case I need to do it again on another machine sometime in the (hopefully distant) future.

## The things I'm starting with:
* homebrew
* ds9
* conda

## The things I'm installing
* astrometry.net
* cfitsio
* fitsh
* ...
